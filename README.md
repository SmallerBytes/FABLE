# H O L L O W — Cyber Infiltration

```
PROJECT HOLLOW / BUILD 0.9.3 / RD-9 BLACKOUT LOADOUT
HOSTILE AI SITE — EMP RAID ARCHIVE
```

A first-person **cyber raid** prototype played in total darkness. The only
vision is a LiDAR scanner: every point is a return you fired. Security is
blind but hears emissions — scans, footsteps, voice, alarms.

No combat. Recover access keys, unlock blast doors, jack into the core,
then board the chopper LZ before it departs.

## Run it

No build step, no dependencies, no network. Either:

- **Open `game/index.html` directly in any modern browser**, or
- serve it (`python -m http.server` from the repo root, then visit
  `http://localhost:8000/game/`).

Headphones strongly recommended. Sound is not decoration here — it is the
primary threat-detection system.

## SOS Mission Command (two-person cyber raid)

HOLLOW supports a Squadron Officer School-style exercise: one **Operator** in
VR, one **Mission Director** with a printed/PDF map directing by voice.

- Exercise guide: [`docs/SOS_Exercise.md`](docs/SOS_Exercise.md)
- Mission map PDF: [`game/assets/HOLLOW_Mission_Map.pdf`](game/assets/HOLLOW_Mission_Map.pdf)
- Printable diagram: [`game/map-print.html`](game/map-print.html)
- Live game: https://smallerbytes.github.io/HOLLOW/game/

**Objective:** recover access keys → unlock blast doors → jack-in circuit puzzle →
board the **LZ** before the chopper departs (8:00 blackout window).

**Harbor green** = Faraday shelter · **Yellow** = tripwire · **LZ** = chopper pad (map-guided).
**Headset mic** speech contributes to signature (EMCON).

## Quest 2 / WebXR

Open **https://smallerbytes.github.io/HOLLOW/game/** in Quest Browser (HTTPS required).

1. Continue past the boot screen and choose **ENTER VR (QUEST)**.
2. Approve immersive VR and microphone permissions.
3. Allow a teammate to download the Mission Map before you enter VR.

Quest controls:

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Head | Look |
| Left stick | Head-relative movement |
| Right stick left/right | 30-degree snap turn |
| Right trigger | Trickle scan aimed by the controller |
| Right grip | Burst sweep |
| A / X / stick-click | Interact |

The headset path renders native stereo views and intentionally bypasses the
desktop CRT barrel-distortion pass. It uses 80% headset framebuffer scale and
draws at most the newest 300,000 points per eye to target Quest 2 performance.
The desktop controls and presentation remain unchanged.

Current VR prototype limitation: the HTML HUD is visible only in the desktop
mirror, not in the headset. Objective status still works through colors,
interaction sounds, and world state.

## Controls

| Input | Action |
|---|---|
| Mouse | Aim |
| Hold LMB | Trickle scan (quiet, narrow) |
| RMB / Space | Burst sweep (paints the whole room — **very loud**) |
| W A S D | Move |
| Shift | Sprint (loud) |
| Ctrl | Crouch (near-silent) |
| E | Interact |

Return colors: phosphor green = surfaces · **harbor green = safe zone** ·
**yellow = laser alarm** · amber = objectives · cyan = documents ·
white = energized exit · **red = it**.

## Design pillars (short form)

1. You are the light — nothing renders unless you scanned it.
2. Sound is truth — every audio cue is information, never mood-only.
3. Tension over terror — one earned jump scare: yours.
4. Diegetic everything — the whole game is a 1988 instrument panel.
5. No combat — the verbs are scan, move, listen, hold still.

See `docs/GDD.md` for the full specification.
